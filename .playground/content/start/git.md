# Git

 It is a compulsory skill for every programmer and the foundation of the foundation. Mastering basic Git usage is a prerequisite for using this topic. Attach the official documentation of Git firstï¼šhttps://git-scm.com/book/zh/v2

## Introduction

In the early days of programmer evolution, all programmers wrote and saved code locally, and when the project became larger and the workload far exceeded personal limits, it was imperative to collaborate and edit together. Then, under the trend of collaborative editing, when all programmers store the code in the same warehouse and the same folder, version management must be done, and the code transfer, save and update functions must be done. Git was born from this, and it is a great tool for collaborative editing. Of course, more emphasis is placed on Git's convenient version management and code synchronization in this topic.
